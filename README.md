This document outlines the complete functional workflow of the Learning Portal Website. It defines how students and instructors interact with the system — from authentication to dashboard operations, topic management, task submission, exam conduction, and grading.
STUDENT SIDE FLOW

Shows a list of tasks assigned by instructors with deadlines. Students can view task details, upload completed files, and update task status.
5. Exam Section
Students can view available exams, take them during scheduled time, and submit answers. After submission, results and grades are available on their dashboard.
6. Progress View
Displays a complete summary of submitted tasks, exam results, and overall academic progress.
INSTRUCTOR SIDE FLOW
1. Instructor Authentication
The system verifies instructor credentials. If valid, redirects to the Instructor Dashboard. Unauthorized access is denied.

Instructors can upload notes, lesson documents, images, and PDFs. Topics can be categorized or dated as Daily Topics for students to access.
4. Task Assignment
Instructors can create tasks with titles, descriptions, and deadlines, assign to individuals or classes, view submissions, and provide grades or feedback.
5. Create / Manage Exams
Instructors can add exam details, schedule timings, insert questions, publish exams, view submissions, grade, and publish results.
6. End of Workflow
After evaluations and result publication, the instructor finalizes grading. Data remains securely stored for future reference.
System Summary
This workflow ensures secure and role-based login for both students and instructors. It supports a complete lifecycle from lesson upload to grading, offering a paperless, efficient educational management experience.
